Enable serial console on Raspberry PI v3 device.

1. Having Rsapbian Linux being installed on RaPi, power it
    off, take SD card and connect it to cardreader. Open folder
    appropriate to /boot folder in Raspbian filesystem.
2. Edit file config.txt to enable UART interface at boot time.
    Add to file these:

# Enable UART
dtparam=uart0=on        # Device uart0 must use UART interface pins on GPIO
dtparam=uart1=off       # Device uart1 must not
dtoverlay=disable-bt    # Bluetooth device must not

3. Edit file cmdline.txt to set UART bitrate 9600.
    Fix bitrate 115200 to 9600. Command line in the file must look like:

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,9600 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait

4. Safe eject SD card from cardreader, install it on RaPi and turn it on.
    Console I/O via UART must appear.
