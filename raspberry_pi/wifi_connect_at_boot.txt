Set Raspberry PI device to enable automatic connect to
network at boot time. Ethernet interface eth0 can be used
in this case for experimental purposes.

1. Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf to configure
    access point you like to get connection to (may be access
    point providing by your home router). File contents must
    look like

ctrl_interface_group=0
ap_scan=1
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="<Access point ESSID name>"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    psk="<Access point password>"
}

    - here may be several 'network' to provide connection
    to many access points.

2. Edit /etc/network interfaces to provide automatic start of
    wpa supplicant and get DHCP lease through WiFi interface,
    with Ethernet interface eth0 being UP but unconfigured. File
    contents must be like:

source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto lo                     # To pull UP
iface lo inet loopback      # To set 127.0.0.1/8 and ::1/128 on it

auto eth0                   # To pull UP
iface eth0 inet manual      # To leave IPv4 unconfigured
iface eth0 inet6 manual     # To leave IPv6 unconfigured

allow-hotplug wlan0         # To configure on going UP
iface wlan0 inet manual     # To leave IPv4 unconfigured
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf    # supplicant autostart
iface default inet dhcp     # To get DHCP lease through default interface
